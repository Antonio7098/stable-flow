# Stable Flow - Agentic Coding Documentation

## Quick Start
This repository uses a streamlined documentation approach optimized for AI model context and rapid development.

### Core Documents
- **PRD.md** - Product requirements, user stories, and feature specifications
- **technical-design.md** - Architecture, technology stack, and deployment strategy  
- **features.csv** - Feature tracking and status matrix
- **development-guide.md** - Coding standards, workflow, and testing guidelines

### Documentation Philosophy
- **AI-Optimized**: Written for maximum AI model comprehension
- **Consolidated**: Related information grouped together
- **Actionable**: Focus on what developers need to know
- **Maintainable**: Easy to keep up-to-date

Contains product requirements, user stories, feature specifications, and project timeline. This is your single source of truth for what needs to be built.

### 🏗️ technical-design.md
Covers system architecture, technology stack, database design, security considerations, and deployment strategy. Essential for understanding how to build the system.

### 📊 features.csv
Feature tracking matrix with priorities, status, assignees, and dependencies. Use this to track progress and plan sprints.

### 💻 development-guide.md
Coding standards, project structure, git workflow, testing guidelines, and code review process. Ensures consistent development practices.

## Optional Documents
