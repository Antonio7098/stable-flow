### ROI Calculation Framework
#### ROI Formula
```
ROI = (Benefits - Costs) / Costs × 100%

Benefits = (Time Saved + Risk Reduction + Quality Improvement) × Value Multiplier
Costs = (Development Time + Testing Time + Deployment Time) × Hourly Rate
```

#### Value Multipliers
- **Time Saved**: [X] hours per week × [X] weeks = [X] hours
- **Risk Reduction**: [X]% reduction in incidents × [X] incidents × [X] cost per incident
- **Quality Improvement**: [X]% reduction in bugs × [X] bugs × [X] cost per bug
- **Developer Productivity**: [X]% improvement × [X] developers × [X] hourly rate
