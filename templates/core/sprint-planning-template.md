# Sprint Planning Overview Template

## Instructions for Creating Sprint Planning
1. **Project Scope**: Define project timeline, sprint length, and total number of sprints
2. **Team Capacity**: Calculate team velocity and sprint capacity based on historical data
3. **Sprint Sequencing**: Plan sprint order based on dependencies and priorities
4. **Milestone Mapping**: Align sprints with project phases and major milestones
5. **Dependency Management**: Identify and track cross-sprint and external dependencies
6. **Risk Planning**: Assess project-level risks and their impact on sprint planning
7. **Resource Allocation**: Ensure team members are properly allocated across sprints
8. **Buffer Planning**: Include buffer time for unknowns and scope changes
9. **Review Cycles**: Plan regular sprint planning review and adjustment cycles
10. **Master Index Update**: If cascade=true in development-guide.md, update master-index.md when sprint strategy or resource allocation changes
11. **Metrics Setup**: Establish tracking mechanisms for velocity and quality metrics
